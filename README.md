# Predict Social Media Addiction Using Machine Learning

This project analyzes the dataset [Students' Social Media Addiction](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adilshamim8/social-media-addiction-vs-relationships) to explore patterns and predictors of social media addiction among students.

The analysis provides insights into how daily usage, sleep, mental health, and demographics relate to social media addiction.

The Machine Learning models trained are meant to explore if any predictions could be made for risk groups, helping to identify students who may be at higher risk of social media addiction.
