# Social Media Addiction Analysis

This project analyzes the dataset "Students_Social_Media_Addiction.csv" to explore patterns and predictors of social media addiction among students.

The analysis provides insights into how daily usage, sleep, mental health, and demographics relate to social media addiction.

The Machine Learning models trained are meant to explore if any predictions could be made for risk groups, helping to identify students who may be at higher risk of social media addiction.

Main steps in the notebook:

- Data loading, cleaning, and exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Visualization of distributions and relationships
- Feature engineering and encoding for machine learning
- Linear Regression to predict addiction scores
- Random Forest Classification to categorize addiction levels (Low, Medium, High)
- Model evaluation using RMSE and accuracy
